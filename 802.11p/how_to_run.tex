In to evaluate performance using PHY abstraction, the frequency response of Urban crossing LOS channel is provided "channel_wlan_data.mat" which can be downloaded from: https://www.dropbox.com/s/tx975gatia41mq1/channel_wlan_data.mat?dl=0

In addition, SINR vs. PER tables are also provided in the folder "Results_11p_awgn.mat"

Then to evaluate PER, PRR, Data rates, or transmission latency relevant script should be simulated.

The V2V channel models can be downloaded from open-source implementation by "Ioannis Sarris from U-box": https://github.com/u-blox/ubx-v2x
