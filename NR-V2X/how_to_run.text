In to evalute performance using PHY abstraction, frequency response of Urban crossing LOS channel is provided "channel_data.mat" and can be downloded from: https://www.dropbox.com/s/tx975gatia41mq1/channel_data.mat?dl=0

In additon SINR vs. PER tables are also provided in the folder "Results_nr_awgn.mat"

Then to evalute PER, PRR, Data rates or transmission latency relvant script should be simualted.

The V2V channel models can be downloded from open source implemention by "Ioannis Sarris from U-box": https://github.com/u-blox/ubx-v2x
